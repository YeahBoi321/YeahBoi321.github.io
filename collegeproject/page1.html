        <h6 style="text-align:center">Tuffy, the Mascot</h6>
        <p>NC State's mascot is, what looks like a wolf, but is really a Tamaskan, a breed of dog. The reason for this is because they have an actual dog as a mascot, named Tuffy, along with their logo/logo-mascot. There have been a total of three live Tuffys!
            Aptly named Tuffy, Tuffy II, and Tuffy III. These dogs were not just named Tuffy though. Tuffy II, who died in October 2021, had a real name of
            <em>Hulk</em>. The latest Tuffy, Tuffy III, is actually the son of Tuffy the first!
            <br><strong>Fun Fact: </strong> NC State had originally tried using real wolves as their live mascots, but it didn't work, because wolves are skittish around crowds, and one time they tried to do this, it was eventually discovered to be a
            coyote, not a wolf!
